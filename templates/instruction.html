                <ul>
                                                           <li>Debut</li>

                                                              <li>Boundless</li>
                                                               <li>Simple</li>
                                                                <li>Venture</li>
                                                                 <li>Minimal</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                        <p>If you ARE using one of these themes, you can skip this step completely! </p>
                                                         <p>If you’re using any other themes, or if you want EcoCart to show up anywhere other than the placement of the auto-integration, you can do this with a little HTML magic. We’ll walk you through that below.</p>
                                                         <p>First, figure out where in your cart you’d like EcoCart to be placed. For example, this store first decided that they would like EcoCart to appear above the CHECKOUT button in their store.</p>
                <img src="../static/img/media/img9.png" alt="">
                <p>To do this, right-click on the checkout button and choose Inspect.</p>
                <img src="../static/img/media/img10.png" alt="">
                <p>This brings up a code inspector. Below is the specific code that comes up when you inspect the checkout button on this cart page.</p>
                <img src="../static/img/media/img11.png" alt="">
                <p>Then find a class or id to reference. For this particular example, below is the code for the checkout button and the class or id to reference is Cart_Checkout.</p>  
                <p>It's important that you choose a class that is unique; otherwise, EcoCart could appear in multiple places throughout the page. You would not want to choose the class Button, for example, because a lot of elements on the page probably use this class. </p>  
                 <img src="../static/img/media/img12.png" alt="">
                 
                 <p>HELPFUL TIP: If the class that you choose happens to be a two-part class name that contains a space like “cart__shipping rte” then all you have to do is remove everything after the space for it to work correctly: “cart__shipping”. Don’t forget to double check that the first part of this class is unique on the page. </p>
                 
                 <img src="../static/img/media/img_22.png" alt="">
                 
                 <p>Once you have decided on a class, copy and paste it into your Customization Settings under “Placement.” In this case, we want the EcoCart box to appear above the element with the class Cart__Checkout, so we selected the “before” placement option. </p>
                 <img src="../static/img/media/img13.png" alt="">
                 <p>Make sure to include a period (.) before any class name, and a hash (#) before any id, following standard CSS notation.</p>
            </div>
            
            
             <div class="instblock">
                <h2><span>7.</span> Design customization</h2>
                <p>Now you get to choose how EcoCart will look within your store. Below you can see how EcoCart looks by default. </p>
                <strong><p>If this works for you, simply click “Enable EcoCart” in the Account Settings tab and you’ll be all set up!</p></strong>
                <img src="../static/img/media/img7.png" alt="">
                <p>HELPFUL TIP: If the checkout info of your cart page is condensed over to one side, then you could end up with EcoCart looking squished like this: </p>
                 <img src="../static/img/media/img_24.png" alt="">
                 <p>To solve for this, we’ve created some design options to choose from for your “condensed cart” here in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_jFDfBZ_R60nipvv6rwCBqYhag27Ja9pl__eu-I1_a4/edit?usp=sharing">doc.</a></p>
                 <p>All you have to do is copy and paste the code for each respective view into the code boxes of your Customization Settings tab of your Shopify dashboard.</p>
                <p>If you want to customize the box, click “No” and HTML & CSS boxes will appear for your complete customization. </p>
                <ul>There are 3 different widget preview boxes:

                    <li>1. Loading View: how the box looks while calculating the cost of making the order carbon neutral</li>
                    <li>2. Website View: when displaying the carbon neutral order amount</li>
                    <li>3. Success View: when a customer has checked the box to make their order carbon neutral.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                 <img src="../static/img/media/img_25.png" alt="">
                 <p>If you are familiar with HTML & CSS, this should all make sense to you. If you have no idea what this all means, we’re happy to help. Just email <strong ><a href="mailto:support@ecocart.io" style="color: #07af4f;">support@ecocart.io</a></strong> and we will custom code the box to your specifications. </p>

                    <h2><span>8.</span> Enable EcoCart</h2>
                <p>Navigate back to the Account Settings tab of your EcoCart Shopify Dashboard and check the box ‘Enable EcoCart.’</p>

                <p>As you might have noticed, the EcoCart carbon neutral “product” automatically shows in the catalog of your store like this:</p>
                <img src="../static/img/media/img15.png" alt="">
                <p>If you don’t want the carbon neutral “product” in your catalog, follow these three easy steps:</p>
                <p>To prevent this from happening, follow these three easy steps:</p>
                                                   <ul>
                                                       <li>1. In the settings of your shop, go to Products > Collections, then click “Create Collection” with the title ‘All’ (if you have a collection titled ‘All’ already, then skip this step)</li>
                                                        <img src="../static/img/media/img16.png" alt="">
                                                        <li>2. Create the following rules for this collection:<br>
                                                     a. Product Price is greater than 0
                                                     b. Product Title is not equal to Carbon Neutral Order
                                                  </li>
                                                   <img src="../static/img/media/img17.png" alt="">
                                                  <li>3. Then go to Products > Carbon Neutral Order > Search Engine Listing Preview and remove the EcoCart’s SEO URL by unchecking the “Create a URL redirect for…” checkbox that appears only after clicking into the ‘URL and handle’ box.</li>
                                                   <img src="../static/img/media/img18.png" alt="">
